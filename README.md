# TotalMarketValue Project

The objective of this report is to perform an exploratory analysis of the “Total Market Value” variable in the context of Colombian soccer. Through the use of different graphical and statistical techniques, we seek to understand the factors that influence the market value of players, explore the distributions of the related variables, and detect possible anomalies or outliers that could be affecting the data. This analysis will serve as a basis for further research, such as the identification of players with growth potential or the prediction of the market value of Colombian soccer teams, which is the main objective of this project.
